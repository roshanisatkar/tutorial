# `python-etl`

In the following repo, you will find a simple ETL process, using different kinds of tools, but basically, `Python`.

The goal is download yesterday's data from Spotify, check if the validation process is approved and finally, load the information needed into the database.

You will need to create a copy from the `.env.example` and call it `env`. There you can put your personal information (`TOKEN`, `USER-ID`,etc.). 

# `ETL` Concept
**Extract**, **Transform** and **Load** it's the process that allows to move data from multiple sources, clean them and load them into a SQL database, that could be used into a Data warehouse.

# Spotify API
Here we will use the Spotify API. You will need to grab you `USER-ID` and generate a `TOKEN` in order to use it. 

# Installation steps

With pip, you can follow this steps:
1. Clone the repository
1. Create a virtual environment called `env`
1. Activate the environment and install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Copy the `.env.example` and call it `env`
1. Change the variables for the ones that you need: `DATABASE_LOCATION`, and from Spotify, `USER_ID`, `TOKEN`.
1. Then, you can run your code with `python3 main.py`


If you want to use poetry instead, you can skip the first 3 steps and run `poetry install`. You need to keep in mind that, to run the code, you'll need to execute: `poetry run python3 main.py`

Python version: `3.9.5`
